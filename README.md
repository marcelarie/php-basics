<center><h1>Basics</h1></center>
In this project you will learn the basic notions of the famous PHP language 
which is so used in the world of web development. 
What distinguishes PHP from other languages such as Javascript is that the code
is executed on the server, generating HTML and sending it to the client.   
The client will receive the result of running the script.
