  <h1 align="center">PHP-Basics</h1>

  <p align="center">
  In this project you will learn the basic notions of the famous PHP language 
  which is so used in the world of web development. What distinguishes PHP from
  other languages such as Javascript is that the code is executed on the server,
  generating HTML and sending it to the client. The client will receive the 
  result of running the script.</p>
